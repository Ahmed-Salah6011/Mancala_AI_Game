# MANCALA GAME

## Implementation Details
We implemented the game using python along with GUI using pyqt5

### Start Page
This is the main page window
you can find the ui design in [start_window.ui](https://github.com/Ahmed-Salah6011/Mancala_AI_Game/blob/master/start_window.ui)
and the python code in [start_page.py](https://github.com/Ahmed-Salah6011/Mancala_AI_Game/blob/master/start_page.py)

Here you have three options:
1. One Player ( Play vs AI )
2. Two Players ( Play vs another Player)
3. Watch and learn ( Watching two AIs player vs each other )

You can choose also one of the two game modes:
1. With Stealing
2. Without Stealing

### Level Page
You can find the ui design in [level_window.ui](https://github.com/Ahmed-Salah6011/Mancala_AI_Game/blob/master/level_window.ui)
and the python code in [level_page.py](https://github.com/Ahmed-Salah6011/Mancala_AI_Game/blob/master/level_page.py)

This window enables you to choose one of three levels:
1. Easy Level ( Depth is 2 )
2. Medium Level ( Depth is 5 )
3. Hard Level ( Depth is 7 )
